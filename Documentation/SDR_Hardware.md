# SDR Hardware and GNURadio

## Overview
In this section we will cover how to use GNURadio to interact with USRP SDR hardware for transmitting and receiving over-the-air signals. We will demonstrate how to obtain the USRP's hardware address, send and receive signals using USRP hardware, set command line parameters (when executing GNURadio flowgraphs outside of GRC), and observe frequency characteristics of carrier modulated waveforms. 

**Tutorial Video:** _Coming Soon_

### Objective

![Flowgraph Image](https://github.com/UCaNLabUMB/SDR_Tutorials/blob/main/Documentation/Images/03_Hardware/GRHardware_03.png)

In this tutorial, we will develop the [SDR_Hardware flowgraph](https://github.com/UCaNLabUMB/SDR_Tutorials/tree/main/Flowgraphs/03_Hardware) shown above. The primary intention of this tutorial is to introduce the methods for communicating with USRP hardware. In particular, we will focus on an instance using two **B200 mini** USRPs which connect to your computer via USB. We will also introduce methods for command line flowgraph execution where parameter values are defined in the Python call, and we will begin to observe some signal properties related to modulated waveforms with random data.

As key learnings for this tutorial, we will cover
* Signal transmission and reception using B200 mini USRPs and GNURadio.
* USRP connections and use of the Linux terminal to acquire the USRP Address(es)
* Use of parameters to enable command line specification of values associated with flowgraph variables
* Considerations related to sample rate, hardware, flowgraph complexity, and processing power
* Signal bandwidth and a basic understanding of multiplexing, and multiple access


### GNURadio Blocks to be Introduced
This tutorial will introduce the following GNURadio blocks:
* UHD: USRP Source Block
* UHD: USRP Sink Block
* Parameter Block
* Random Source Block
* Repeat Block






# USRP Hardware and GNURadio
We first aim to create a simple flowgraph, shown below, that allows GNURadio to send and receive signals to/from USRP hardware. To do this, we will confirm that the computer can communicate with the USRP, then we will set appropriate parameters in the GNURadio flowgraph to enable signal transmission and reception.

## USRP Hardware Driver (UHD)
Now that we are moving from simulation to observation of signals in the physical world, we need to add SDR hardware into our setup. In the image below, we see our Linux computer running GRC and two B200 mini USRPs connected via USB. 

![Hardware Setup](https://github.com/UCaNLabUMB/SDR_Tutorials/blob/main/Documentation/Images/03_Hardware/GRHardware_01_01.jpg)

* **NOTE:** The USRP on the right has a VERT900 antenna attached the TRX connection, and the USRP on the left has a VERT900 antenna attached to the RX2 connection. This is relevant as we will be sending our signals in the 900MHz ISM band, and these antennas are optimized for that frequency range. 

When using the B200 mini USRPs, our ability to communicate with the devices should be as simple as plugging in the USB port, however, other USRPs require additional setup (e.g., N Series and X Series USRPs use Ethernet instead of USB and require IP address assignment to ensure that your computer's Ethernet network interface card is able to communicate with the USRPs). 

To confirm that we can communicate with the connected USPRs, we will use the `uhd_find_devices` command to search for connected USRPs and determine the address(es) of any USRPs that are found. Along with most installations of GNURadio, you will have also installed the UHD library. **UHD**, or USRP Hardware Driver, is how GNURadio communicates with USRPs. From the Linux terminal, you can type `uhd_find_devices`, as shown below. In this case, the two USRPs are found and the Serial addresses are reported. We will need these addresses when defining which USRPs we are using in the GNURadio flowgraph.

![UHD Find Devices](https://github.com/UCaNLabUMB/SDR_Tutorials/blob/main/Documentation/Images/03_Hardware/GRHardware_01_02.png)

* **NOTE:** You can notice in the image above that firmware is first loaded to each of the USRPs before they return their address information. Whenever the B200 mini USRPs are powered up the firmware must be loaded onto the hardware so that they know how to function. If you call `uhd_find_devices` a second time, you will notice that the response comes back quicker and you will not see the INFO message stating "_Loading Firmware Image_ ..." since the firmware has already been loaded to the USRPs. If you power cycle the USRPs (i.e., unplug the USB cables) the firmware will be loaded again the next time your computer attempts to communicate with the USRPs.

* **NOTE:** The first time you try to connect to a USRP, you may need to download the relevant USRP firmware images and/or set appropriate privileges. If you receive an error related to either of these issues, you can review the UHD and USRP Manual for instructions related to the [UHD images downloader](https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_images.html) tool or [setting Udev rules](https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_transport.html).




## Adding USRP Source and Sink Blocks
Once we have confirmed that our computer can communicate with the connected USRPs, we can create the GNURadio flowgraph below to actually send/receive signals to/from the USRPs.

![Flowgraph Image](https://github.com/UCaNLabUMB/SDR_Tutorials/blob/main/Documentation/Images/03_Hardware/GRHardware_01.png)

* **NOTE:** Compared to the simulation flowgraphs we've seen before, we should notice that this flowgraph does NOT have a Throttle block. The USRPs are clocked devices that control the rate at which samples are accepted or generated, so we do not need to include the Throttle block to managing the flow rate of samples passing through our flowgraph. 

The signal path in this flowgraph connects the **Signal Source** and **QT GUI Sink** blocks that we've already seen to two new blocks, namely the **UHD: USRP Sink** and **UHD: USRP Source** blocks. Once these blocks are added, you can connect the Signal Source to the USRP Sink and the USRP Source to the QT GUI Sink.
* USRP Sink blocks use the UHD library to send signals to the USRPs.â€‹ By default, USRP Sink blocks accept complex baseband samples from the flowgraph and handle the interpolation, digital to analog conversion, and carrier modulation so that the RF signal can be sent over the air with a user-defined center frequency.
* USRP Source blocks use the UHD library to receive signals from the USRPs. The USRP handles carrier demodulation, conversion to digital samples, and decimation to provide a digital stream of complex samples to the GNU Radio flowgraph. These samples relate to the complex-baseband representation of the RF signal received at the user-defined center frequency.

* **NOTE:** In the context of these UHD blocks, _Sink_ and _Source_ refer to the direction of data flow in GNURadio. In other words, the Sink block is accepting data from GNURadio (even though it is in fact for signal transmission) and the Source block is generating data within GNURadio (even though it is actually associated with the USRP that is receiving the physical signal).
