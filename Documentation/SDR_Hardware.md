# SDR Hardware and GNURadio

## Overview
In this section we will cover how to use GNURadio to interact with USRP SDR hardware for transmitting and receiving over-the-air signals. We will showcase how to obtain the USRP's hardware address, send and receive signals using USRP hardware, set command line parameters (when executing GNURadio flowgraphs outside of GRC), and observe frequency characteristics of carrier modulated waveforms.

In this tutorial, we will develop the [SDR_Hardware flowgraph](https://github.com/UCaNLabUMB/SDR_Tutorials/tree/main/Flowgraphs/03_Hardware) shown above. 


### GNURadio Blocks to be Introduced
This tutorial will introduce the following blocks from GNURadio:
* UHD: USRP Source Block
* UHD: USRP Sink Block
* Parameter Block
* Random Source Block
* Repeat Block





### Key Learnings

GNURadio can be utilized for a straightforward TX/RX setup with Ettus B200 mini USRPs.
It is important to be aware the we can utilize GNURadio for both traditional Radio Frequency applications and it can be also adapted for 
The Linux terminal is a handy tool to obtain the USRP Serial Address via UHD find devices.
GNU Radio Flowgraph allows the effective use of USRPs.

Practical Applications
Implement Ettus B200 mini USRPs in a simple TX/RX setup using GNURadio.
Use the Linux terminal to acquire the USRP Serial Address via UHD find devices for device identification.
Integrate USRP's in a GNU Radio Flowgraph for efficient signal processing.
Apply the USRP SINK Block for the TX USRP within a flowgraph to transmit signals.
Use the USRP Source for the RX USRP Flow to receive signals.
Leverage the QT GUI WaterFall Sink block for visualization of the receiver signal, facilitating real-time analysis and signal adjustment.









# USRP Hardware and GNURadio

## USRP Hardware Driver (UHD)
_Connecting USRPs to computer_

_Setting IP addresses (if needed... X or N Series)_

_Calling_ `uhd_find_devices`

_Getting USRP images if needed_

## Adding USRP Source and Sink Blocks
In this flowgraph we are going to make a couple of changes to one we created with the GNURadio basic flowgraph. We need to put a USRP Sink block place of the throttle block. This will send the singal generation into the B200 Mini. The next thing that we need to do is to imput a USRP Source block. This is responsible for recieving the collected signal from the USRP and then bringing it back into the flowgraph. Once we have this done all we need to do is reconnect the output into our QT GUI of Choice. For all of this to work we have to retrive the Serial Address from the computer terminal via the UHD_Find_Devices command. What this does is report the serial address of the usrp, and then we take this string unput and place it into the slot for serial addresses in both the USRP source and sink blocks. 

* UHD:USRP Sink allows us to send intended signal into USRPs.â€‹ The USRP Sink block in GNU Radio streams samples to a connected USRP hardware device for transmission over the air. It takes in complex baseband samples from the flowgraph and handles modulation, interpolation, conversion to analog signals etc. needed for the USRP to transmit the signals wirelessly. The parameters like center frequency, gain, antennas can be configured. It is used to transmit signals generated and processed within GNU Radio over real hardware radios.
* UHD:USRP Source allows to retrieve intended signal from USRPs. The USRP Source block in GNU Radio receives samples from a connected USRP hardware device after reception from its antennas. It handles decimation, demodulation, conversion to digital samples etc. to provide a stream of complex baseband samples into the GNU Radio flowgraph. The parameters like center frequency, gain, sample rate, antennas can be configured to correctly receive the wireless signals. It is used to transfer signals received by the USRP into GNU Radio for further processing and analysis.
