# GNURadio Automated Data Collection

## Overview
In this tutorial we will cover a couple of things. First we will see how to set up the GNURadio flowgraph via a command line start with intended parameters. Next after we will take our learning from the Networking and the GNURadio command and control in order to implement a PER test (packet error rate) witch will utilize both XML_RPC and ZMQ for control and monitoring of the flowgraph parameters. After this we will build upon this with the same flowgraph as the last tutorial but will that will cover OFDMA carrier allocation with will once again utilize XML_RPC. 

### Key Learnings

XML-RPC can help use with subcarrier selection by send the parameter update to the select blocks and picking which signal path we want to use. We can automate data collection with batch scripting and xml-rpc to save individual setup flowgraph denerations to a file naming convention we want.
