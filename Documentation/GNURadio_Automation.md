# GNURadio Automated Data Collection

## Overview
In this tutorial we will cover a couple of things. First we will see how to set up the GNURadio flowgraph via a command line start with intended parameters. Next after we will take our learning from the Networking and the GNURadio command and control in order to implement a PER test (packet error rate) witch will utilize both XML_RPC and ZMQ for control and monitoring of the flowgraph parameters. After this we will build upon this with a new bespoke flowgraph that will cover OFDMA carrier allocation with will once again utilize both ZMQ and XML_RPC. 

### Key Learnings

## Flowgraph setup for cmd line start with parameters


## Repeatable PER test with XMLRPC and ZMQ



## Modifications for different scenarios (e.g., subcarrier assignment)
