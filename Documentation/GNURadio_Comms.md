# GNURadio Command and Control

## Overview
In this tutorial we will combine our learning over the past tuturials and combine them in order to achive different functional flowgraph. First we will start with OFDM Simulation with no hardware elementets, and after we will then introduce hardware with over the air data transmission and then go into packet error rate testing.

### Key Learnings
