# Simple GNURadio TX/RX

## Overview
This is an overview of GNURadio Flowgraph best practices. It will cover flowgraph creation in GNURadio, signal generation and utilizing the QT Gui Sink. It will cover how to use the throttle block for flowgraph creation as it is used for simulation purposes in GNURadio.
### Key Learnings
-Flowgraph creation is simple once you understand the key guiding princibles. 
-Variables help improve the managability and help clean up the flowgraph. 
-Float to complex blocks is one of the GNURadio blocks that would be used frequently in a variery of flowgraph creations.
-In terms of visulization the QT GUI libary is the best tool for visulization in GNU Radio


### GNURadio Blocks to be Introduced
* Block 1
* Block 2
* ...









### Objectives
Flowgraph creation and throttle blocks for simulation.​
Create flowgraphs that are easy to adapt and change parameters​.
Add variables to enable for more complex GR flowgraphs.​
Utilize Conversion Blocks with Float to Complex block.​
Flowgraph Management with Virtual Source & Sink​
Utilize variables for more easier value management.​
Utilize QT GUI Range to change values in a running flowgraph. 

### Flowgraph Creations
Variables are able to be used within existing GR Blocks.​
Variables allows for easy management of multiple GR values used in different blocks
QT Gui Range enables us to be able predefine ranges and default  values to utilize during a running flowgraph. ​
Showcase that we can utilize QT GUI Blocks to manipulate both filter and frequency values during flowgraph runtime.
