## Objectives
Flowgraph creation and throttle blocks for simulation.
Create flowgraphs that are easy to adapt and change parameters.
Add variables to enable for more complex GR flowgraphs.
Utilize Conversion Blocks with Float to Complex block.
Flowgraph Management with Virtual Source & Sink
Utilize variables for more easier value management.
Utilize QT GUI Range to change values in a running flowgraph.
## Flowgraph Best Practices
Variables are able to be used within existing GR Blocks.
Variables allows for easy management of multiple GR values used in different blocks
QT Gui Range enables us to predefine ranges and default values to utilize during a running flowgraph.
Showcase that we can utilize QT GUI Blocks to manipulate both filter and frequency values during flowgraph runtime.
